# Daily Catch üé£

Daily catch is an application I built for keeping track of what bugs and fish are out right now for you to catch, as well as other daily tasks available to you in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

There are a few features I definitely want to add:

- Edge-cases
  - Currently, there's a few edge cases that the current implementation doesn't reflect. For instance, this program only shows King Salmon as available in the river, though technically they're only in the river on 9/15-9/30, and are in the ocean mouth on 9/1-9/14. Small things, but they should be accounted for if this tool is to be accurate, and this is going to be one of, if not the first update I push.
- Bugs!!!
- Deep-sea creatures!
- Meteor shower days
  - these would require a town seed, and I'll have to look into if something like [MeteoNook](https://wuffs.org/acnh/weather/) provides an API (it is open-source, so hopefully I can work from that.)
  - if I can access meteonook seeds, I would also want to have the background of the site show the weather in your town (it's already colored based on the current hour)
- Toggle caught bugs/fish
  - somewhere, have a way to select all fish/bugs you've already caught, and hide those from the main page, resulting in it only showing you what new creatures you can currently catch.
- Rarity
- Prerequisites
  - some creatures are only out during rain, or other conditions, and to have those accounted better/at all would be nice.
  - Currently, when I see a rain/snow prequisite, I'm going to add an emoji in the `Location` tag, though I hope to have a more clean approach (ideally a `Conditions` tag or similar, which would add [an mdi design](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/mdi/weather-pouring/) somewhere beside the entry) in the future.
  - Prior to a town seed integration, I'll likely mark effected creatures with an icon (raindrop or similar), but afterwards, I would like to have them show on the list only if all conditions are met.
- Add option to sort by creaturepedia entry #, opposed to alphabetically
  - This shouldn't be too hard, I just need to go into creaturepedia (or pull up on a wiki) and find the index number for each fish/bug.
- Better webpage layout
  - Specifically, I want to have some nice, yet unobtrusive menus, as well as have the site more visually appealing on desktop / landscape views, apposed to the phone-centric layout it currently has (although I also do not want to jeopardize the mobile layout in any way, as I see this being the way the majority of users access the app)

There's also some lower-priority features that I would like to add to this some time. In no particular order:

- have a "later today" section for fish/bugs that aren't available yet, but will be that night.
  - I probably want to implement this after I implement toggling caught creatures, since it could be redundant and clutterful otherwise.
  - I also would like to give the user the option to "remind me when this fish is out", which would send the user a notification at the hour the fish comes out. 
- shadow size for fish
- price for bug/fish in bells
  - it would be nice to have normal timmy-tommy prices, as well as what flick and chuck would pay.
- support for other animal crossing games
  - implementing that shouldn't be difficult, but it would be a lot of work
- Support toggling 12/24hr and Northern/Southern hemispheres
- Icons for location
  - I would like to either find, make, or commission icons for the different locations creatures can be found, so that it's less text and more visual information.

## Notes üìù

This project is obviously not affiliated with, or endorsed by Nintendo in any way. Also, this is largely a project I'm using to practice my JavaScript, so I know the code isn't the best (and I could probably do without the `File` in the arrays). If you want to fix or optimize anything here, feel free to do a pull request.
